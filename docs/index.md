## What is Multi-Agent Reasoning Systems (MARSYS)?

**Multi-Agent Reasoning Systems (MARSYS)** is a Python framework for building intelligent systems where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. Unlike single-agent approaches, our framework enables autonomous agent discovery, seamless communication, and continuous learning from interactions—creating true multi-agent teams that work like human specialists.

The framework supports all major AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and local models via Hugging Face, offering flexibility in model selection. With built-in browser automation, memory management, and learning capabilities, you can create sophisticated agent systems with just a few lines of code.
